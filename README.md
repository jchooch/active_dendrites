# Neuron Model with Active Dendrites

This code implements a two-compartment neuron model with active dendritic spike propagation.
This model was inspired by work done in **[Larkum et al. (2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15115747/) Top-down dendritic input increases the gain of layer 5 pyramidal neurons**.
