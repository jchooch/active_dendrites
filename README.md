# Neuron Model with Active Dendrites

This code implements a two-compartment neuron model with active dendritic spike propagation.
This model was described/inspired by:
**[Larkum et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15115747/) â€” Top-down dendritic input increases the gain of layer 5 pyramidal neurons**.

## TODO

- Figure out all the units.
- Figure out what experiments we need to run (parameters, inputs).
- Graph currents.
